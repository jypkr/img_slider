# img_slider

This is a simple JavaScript project that allows you to create an image slider. It includes an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the page, the CSS file is used to style the page, and the JavaScript file contains the code for the image slider.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can download or clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the image slider in action.

## Usage

The image slider is very simple to use. It automatically slides through the images at a set interval, but you can also navigate through the images manually by clicking on the navigation buttons.

## Customization

If you want to customize the image slider, you can do so by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files. The CSS file contains the styles for the slider, and the JavaScript file contains the code for the slider functionality.
